Project:	CHIP-8 Emulator
Date Started:   September 9, 2018

Description:
	A simple emulation of the CHIP-8 interpreted language written in C++.
	Used Cowgod's technical reference [1] for opcode implementations.
	Tested with "PONG" game from David Winter's www.pong-story.com/chip8/

Platforms:
	Linux 32/64-bit distributions
		
Dependencies:
	g++ (compiler)
	make (for the Makefile)
	SFML 2.5.0 (and up) for window and 2D rendering functions.

Build Instructions:
      To build, type:
            make clean	
      	    make

Run instructions (using ROM as the name of file):
    To run with selected ROM, type:
        ./Chip8 ROM

Clean up:
      To remove all .o and compiled executables, type:
            make clean


Issues:
	* Out-of-bounds segmentation fault found while testing PONG ROM,
	  detected whenever player paddle passes screen bounds.
